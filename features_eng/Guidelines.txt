Here is a few guideline for you

- Always push on the dev branch
- Before push anything, must pull the repository
- Feature engineering related notebooks/script must to this folder




folder docomentation 

this folder contain all the Feature engineering related notebooks/script 
and the documentation of the project
in this folder we trid to create script to create our dataset 


1. Feature-Engineering,ipynb
   --> date formating 
   --> sector volume 
   --> a catagoic stock 
   --> gold price global 
   --> foren exchange rate buy and sell 
   --> Dsex, Ds30 ,Dses 
   --> Ds30, Ds30, Dses change 
   --> bd reserve 
   --> ranking by sector volume


2. Weighted_correlation_analysis.ipynb

To analyze the relationship between companies listed in Dhaka Stock Exchange
Steps:
   --> Scraping the 26 fundamental features and 400 days of technical data (close price) from stocknow.
   --> Checking the distribution status of both fundamental and technical data using the Shapiro-Wilk test.
   --> Applying normalization techniques such as MinMaxScaler to ensure all features have the same scale and importance.
   --> Merging the datasets based on company name to combine fundamental and technical data for each company.
   --> Applying correlation analysis using three methods: Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall's Tau to understand the relationship between variables and their strength.
   --> Using the Pearson and Spearman method segmented weight to prioritize fundamental features for weighted correlation analysis.
         Expected outcomes:
   --> Insights into the relationship between fundamental features and technical data for a set of companies listed on DSE.
   --> Potential to develop investment strategies based on identified correlations.




3. desx_dsex_ds30_value_handeling.ipynb

   --> Deu ot not avalbility of Dsex, Ds30 ,Dses until 2010-01-01, all the value of Dsex, Ds30 ,Dses are filled with 0.0 
      to handel tihs we use the following method
      we replace i th element of dsex ,ds30 , dese with avg of last 15 day 


4. drop_TI.ipynb 
   --> drop all the technical indicator from the dataset with most amount of 0 value

5. Data_Filling.ipynb

   --> Year High 
        --> The "Year High" column in a stock market dataset is calculated by identifying the highest price at which a particular stock was traded during a specific year.
            based on the data in the "High" column, finally difference between this Highest value & Current stock price “Close”.

   --> Year Low 
        --> The "Year Low" column in a stock market dataset is calculated by identifying the Lowest price at which a particular stock was traded during a specific year.
            based on the data in the "Low" column & finally difference between this Lowest value & Current stock price “Close”.

   --> Gold Rate BD 
        --> Data on gold prices in Bangladesh is sourced from the Bangladesh Jewellers Association (BAJUS), and includes various categories such as 22k, 21k, 18k, and Sonaton.
            To simplify the analysis, only the average of the 21k and 22k categories is used.

   --> Price/EPS 
        --> The earnings per share (EPS) of a particular company are obtained from Stocknow, a financial data provider.To calculate the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of the company,
            the current stock price (found in the "Close" column) is divided by the EPS value. 
   --> Dividend Yield 
        --> The cash dividend per share data for a particular company is obtained from Stocknow. To calculate the dividend yield, 
            the cash dividend per share is divided by the share price (found in the "Close" column).

   --> 1st Support 
   --> 2nd Support  
        --> To calculate 1st & 2nd support first obtained Pivot point of specific stock applying the formula of  Pivot point = (High + Low + Close)/3,
            and finally calculate the 1st and 2nd support:
            1st Support = Pivot point *2 - Low
            2nd Support = Pivot point - (High - Low)

   --> 1st Resistance  
   --> 2nd Resistance
        --> 1st Resistance = Pivot point * 2 - Low
            2nd Resistance = Pivot point + (High - Low)


 -->  The net asset value (NAV) per share data for a particular company is obtained from Stocknow, a financial data provider.
     To calculate the price-to-NAV ratio, the current share price (found in the "Close" column) is divided by the NAV per share.


6. Beta.ipynb

    --> Beta

        To calculate Beta we need to calculate first:
        -->Average daily return of the speciefic stock over the period of time
        -->Average daily return of the market(DSEX) over the same period of time
        -->Covariance of the stock's daily returns with the market's daily returns
        -->Calculate the variance of the market's daily returns
        -->Finally Divide the covariance of the stock's daily returns with the market's daily returns by the variance of the market's daily returns to obtain the stock's beta.
